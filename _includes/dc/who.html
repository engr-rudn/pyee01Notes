  <strong>Course Structure:</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Part 1:
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
FUNDAMENTALS OF ERS
</strong>
Learn the ways of collecting information about our planet with satellites, as well as modern applications of this information. You will get familiar with physical basics of Earth Remote Sensing (ERS), satellites and sensors, characteristics of images and see how it helps us face environmental, social and economic challenges.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Part 2:
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
PYHTON FOR IMAGE ANALYSIS​
</strong>
Get familiar with Python as a tool for geospatial image analysis. You will have a quick recap of Python basics followed by a specific workflows and libraries that are used for geospatial analysis. Practical part includes working in Jupyter / Colab notebooks.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    Part 3:
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
EARTH ENGINE PYHTON API​
</strong>
Hone skills in working with a multi-petabyte catalog of big satellite image data and try yourself as a data analyst. You will develop your own algorithms to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface, and then publish them as web-based applications.

  <strong>
    P1: Remote Sensing - 
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
The aim of the module is to provide the basis for understanding of the remote sensing of the Earth. Satellites are an important tool for the geosciences and innumerable practical applications. We have tried to homogenize the terminology the principles of interpretation and the general approach in this course. ​

Basics of Remote Sensing (RS)​

Types of Satellite Sensors and platform ​

RS Satellite Characteristics​

RS Data Processing Levels​

Digital image principles​

etc …​

  <strong>
    P2: Python for Image Analysis - 
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
This module gives students an understanding of remote sensing image analysis using python programming language. 
    
Some of the contents that will be discussed in this module are: ​​

A quick introduction to Python    ​

Getting familiar with Python 3.x as a tool for geospatial image analysis ​

Working on Libraries/environments that enable local and Cloud-based image analysis using python (working in Jupyter / Colab notebooks)​
</p>

<p>
  <strong>
    P3: Earth Engine Platform - 
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
EARTH ENGINE PYHTON API​
</strong>
This module gives students an understanding of the techniques of processing large scale ERS data in the Earth Engine environment, with an emphasis on being able to apply those techniques to future analysis. Students will be able to carry out typical workflows in data processing and product generation.
<strong>Covered topics:</strong> Introduction to GEE; Platform Components; Data Structures; Basic Algorithms; Importing and Exporting Data; Charting; Time-Series Analysis; Classification;​
